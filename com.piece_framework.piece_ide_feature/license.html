<h2>GNU General Public License, version 2</h2>

<P>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
		       Version 2, June 1991<BR>
<BR>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<BR>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR>
<BR>
			    Preamble<BR>
<BR>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<BR>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<BR>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<BR>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<BR>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<BR>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<BR>
your programs, too.<BR>
<BR>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR>
<BR>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<BR>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<BR>
<BR>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<BR>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<BR>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<BR>
rights.<BR>
<BR>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<BR>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<BR>
distribute and/or modify the software.<BR>
<BR>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<BR>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<BR>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<BR>
authors' reputations.<BR>
<BR>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<BR>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<BR>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<BR>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<BR>
<BR>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>
modification follow.<BR>
<BR>
		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR>
<BR>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<BR>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<BR>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<BR>
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<BR>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<BR>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<BR>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<BR>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<BR>
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<BR>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<BR>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<BR>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<BR>
<BR>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<BR>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<BR>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<BR>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<BR>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<BR>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<BR>
along with the Program.<BR>
<BR>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<BR>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<BR>
<BR>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<BR>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<BR>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR>
<BR>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR>
<BR>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<BR>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<BR>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<BR>
    parties under the terms of this License.<BR>
<BR>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<BR>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<BR>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<BR>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<BR>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<BR>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<BR>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<BR>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<BR>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<BR>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<BR>
<BR>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<BR>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>
collective works based on the Program.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<BR>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<BR>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>
the scope of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<BR>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<BR>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<BR>
<BR>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<BR>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR>
<BR>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<BR>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<BR>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<BR>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<BR>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR>
<BR>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<BR>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<BR>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<BR>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<BR>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<BR>
<BR>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<BR>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<BR>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<BR>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<BR>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<BR>
itself accompanies the executable.<BR>
<BR>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<BR>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR>
<BR>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<BR>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<BR>
parties remain in full compliance.<BR>
<BR>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<BR>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>
the Program or works based on it.<BR>
<BR>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<BR>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<BR>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>
this License.<BR>
<BR>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<BR>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<BR>
<BR>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<BR>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<BR>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<BR>
circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<BR>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>
impose that choice.<BR>
<BR>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<BR>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<BR>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<BR>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<BR>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<BR>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>
address new problems or concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<BR>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<BR>
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<BR>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<BR>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<BR>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<BR>
Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<BR>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<BR>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<BR>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<BR>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<BR>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<BR>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR>
<BR>
			    NO WARRANTY<BR>
<BR>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<BR>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<BR>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<BR>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<BR>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR>
<BR>
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<BR>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<BR>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<BR>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<BR>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<BR>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<BR>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR>
<BR>
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR>
<BR>
	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR>
<BR>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR>
<BR>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR>
<BR>
    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<BR>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<BR>
<BR>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<BR>
    (at your option) any later version.<BR>
<BR>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR>
<BR>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<BR>
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR>
<BR>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<BR>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR>
<BR>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<BR>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<BR>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<BR>
<BR>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<BR>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<BR>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<BR>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<BR>
<BR>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<BR>
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<BR>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<BR>
<BR>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<BR>
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<BR>
<BR>
  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<BR>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<BR>
<BR>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<BR>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<BR>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<BR>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<BR>
Public License instead of this License.<BR>
